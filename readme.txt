In this Project I interact with the moviedb RESTful API to implement GET and POST methods.
Most of this was code-a-long course from Brad Traversy' Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 on Udemy.
I also added some of my own features to make the client experience more complete and show I work in colaboration with legacy code.
